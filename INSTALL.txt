Step 1
------
To use this project, feed the location.mysql to your database.  If your site
is using a prefix for database table names, make sure to adjust accordingly.

  mysql -u username -ppassword -h localhost database-name < location.mysql

where "username", "password" are the username/loging and "database-name" are
the parameters to login to your Drupal site's database.  You can leave out
"-h localhost" if your MySQL server runs on the same site as your Apache.
However, replace 'localhost' in "-h localhost" if your MySQL server is on a 
different machine.

IMPORTANT:
To support proximity searches and most useful features, you will need a postal codes
database for each country for which you plan to use a file from the "supported/"
directory. 

As of this post, only U.S. and German postal codes are supported.  However, you will
need a database of postal codes.  A single zipcodes table holds all the
zipcodes.  To create the zipcodes table using the database/zipcodes.mysql file
from within the location tarball:

  mysql -u username -ppassword -h localhost database-name < zipcodes.mysql

To make use of the U.S. postalcodes:

  mysql -u username -ppassword -h localhost database-name < zipcodes.us.mysql

To make use of the German postal codes:

  mysql -u username -ppassword -h localhoost database-name < zipcodes.de.mysql

Feed these dumps to your database as well, adjusting for prefixes.  Careful, the
postal code dump for the US is a few MB.

Step 2
------
In the "modules/" directory, create a subdirectory called "location/" which itself
contains a subdirectory called "supported/".

Download "location.inc" to "location/"
Download "location.module" to "location/"
Download "earth.inc" to "location/"
Download "supported/location.us.inc" to "location/supported/"
(NOTE: "supported/location.ca.inc" for Canada is not yet complete).

Step 3
------
Enable the location module on your site.
Visit the settings page for location.module and enable features for U.S. (the only option as of now).
Finally, go to the default workflow settings for each node type and enable (or require location collection
on a field-by-field basis... it is encouraged that you enable postal codes and country fields for node types
for which you want to enable proximity searches.
