Step 1
------
To use this project, feed the location.mysql to your database.  If your site
is using a prefix for database table names, make sure to adjust accordingly.

IMPORTANT:
To support proximity searches and most useful features, you will need a postal codes
database for each country for which you plan to use a file from the "supported/"
directory. 

As of this post, only U.S. postal codes are supported.  However, you will need a
database of postal codes.  A database dump for a U.S. postal codes table can be
found at http://trac.civicspacelabs.com/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/file/trunk/database/zipcodes.mysql

Feed this dump to your database as well, adjusting for prefixes.  Careful, the
postal code dump for the US is a few MB.

Step 2
------
In the "modules/" directory, create a subdirectory called "location/" which itself
contains a subdirectory called "supported/".

Download "location.inc" to "location/"
Download "location.module" to "location/"
Download "earth.inc" to "location/"
Download "supported/location.us.inc" to "location/supported/"
(NOTE: "supported/location.ca.inc" for Canada is not yet complete).

Step 3
------
Enable the location module on your site.
Visit the settings page for location.module and enable features for U.S. (the only option as of now).
Finally, go to the default workflow settings for each node type and enable (or require0 location collection
on a field-by-field basis... it is encouraged that you enable postal codes and country fields for node types
for which you want to enable proximity searches.
