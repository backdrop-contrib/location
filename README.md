Location
========

Associate real-world geographic locations to Backdrop entities.

The Location module allows real-world geographic locations to be associated 
with Backdrop entities, including people, places, and other content. The 
Location module allows admins to collect addresses, geocode them (translate 
addresses to lattitude/longitude), and associate locations with Drupal nodes 
and users. Location data is automatically used to generate GeoRSS within your 
existing RSS feeds.

Note: This module contains many sub-modules. At the moment, only Location core 
and Node Locations have been ported to Backdrop.
